# Ice_Cube_project_CMEPDA
Repository for the final project for the course "Computing Methods for Energy Physics and Data Analysis"

The project focused on the analysis of IceCube simulations. In particular, the goal is to predict the spatial origin of incident particles by studying the hits left by the particles inside the detector.
